# PLEASE
## Datasets
The datasets utilized in our study are sourced from Wattanakriengkrai et al., containing 32 releases across 9 software projects. For access to the datasets, please refer to this [github](https://github.com/awsm-research/line-level-defect-prediction).

For each software project, we use the initial release to train PLEASE model. The second release is used as validation set, and the other releases are used as testing sets. For example, there are 5 releases in ActiveMQ (e.g., R1, R2, R3, R4, R5), R1 is used as training set, R2 is used as validation set, and R3 - R5 are used as testing sets.
